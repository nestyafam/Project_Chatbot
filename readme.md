> Boilerplate to kickstart creating a messenger bot

## Getting started

You can `git clone` or [download](https://github.com/richwednesday/messenger-bot-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) this repo and get contents of the `boilerplate`.

`git clone https://github.com/richwednesday/messenger-bot-boilerplate.git project_name` more often does the trick.

Happy bot building :)
